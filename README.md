# AQ

**An Asynchronous Queue implementation for JS/TS (Deno)**

AQ is a lightweight asynchronous queue implementation with no dependencies. As of it's current state (v0.1) it may not be safe to use in production code. Also since the code uses modern ES2019 (ES10) features like [Private Class Fields](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_class_fields) make sure that you have the right environment. It's tested with Deno 1.92 and should also be OK with Node v12+, Chrome 74+, Edge 79+.

**Functionality**

- AQ is a FIFO queue structure which can take both asynchronous and synchronous items at the same time. The `enqueue`d items, regardless being sync or async are wrapped by a promise (outer promise). A resolution of the inner promise (`enqueue`d item) triggers the *previous* outer promise in the queue to be resolved. Since the previous inner promise is doing the same thing, this chained resolution mechanism forms the basis of an uninterrupted continuum. Such as when the queue becomes empty (all inner promises are depleted) there is still one outer promise yielded at the tip of the queue, waiting for a resolution or rejection. It will remain there, keeping the queue alive,  up until something new gets `enqueue`d and eventually fulfills.
- The item at the head of the queue gets automatically dequeued once it resolves or instantly if it's already in the resolved state. All other items in the queue must wait until they become the head regardless of their state (pending or resolved). So there is no  `dequeue` method in AQ at all.
- The rejections are handled inside the queue either silently or through a handler function if provided. This also means while consuming from AQ instances you don't need to deploy a `try` & `catch` functionality.
- There are also three events such as "next", "error" and "empty", those can be listened by event listener functions. The event listener functions can be added / removed freely at any time. Every event can hold multiple event listener functions.
- Once an AQ instance is intiated it will run indefinitelly, available for `enqueue`ing.
- Being an async iterator, AQ instances are ideally consumed by a `for await of` loop.

**Instances**

The AQ constructor takes an options argument. Simply called as,

    var aq = new AQ(opts);

and consumed like

	async function getAsyncValues(aq){
	  for await (let item of aq){
	    console.log(`The Promise at endpoint resolved with a value of "${item}"`);
	  };
	};

The **options** object argument (`opts` above) could take the following shape

    var opts  = { timeout  : 200
                , errHandle: false // errh
                , clearMode: "soft"
                };

- **`timeout`:** Since AQ instances get `dequeue`d automatically one thing that we shall avoid is to have an indefinitelly pending promise in the queue. The `timeout` property is of `Number` type and defines a duration in ms. `timeout` should always be provided unless you are sure that all `enqueue`d items are either synchronous or promises those will certainly resolve or reject within a reasonable time.
- **`errHandle`:** Since AQ instances are silent, the rejections within the queue are not emitted to the outside. Instead in case you need to react against the rejections you can define an error handler function and assign it to the `opts.errhHandle` property. As of v0.1 `errHandle` only handles the errors caught at the head. The promise rejections behind the head are **not** handled by `errHandle`. Instead use the `"error"` event if you want to handle the errors originated from elsewhere in the queue.
- **`clearMode`:** AQ instances have a `.clear(clearMode)` method used to clear the queue at any time. `clearMode` can take only two values. `"hard"` or `"soft"`.
    - `"hard"` clears all the items in the queue regardless their state.
    - `"soft"` clears all the items in the queue except for the ones in resolved state.

**Methods**
As of v0.1 the following methods are available

- **`.enqueue(item)`:** Inserts an item to the end of the queue. and increments the `size` of the queue. The return value is the current AQ instance.
- **`.clear("hard" | "soft")`:** Depending on the provided argument clears the queue either completely or by keeping the items in resolved state respectively. The return value is the current AQ instance.
- **`.flush()`:** Similar to `.clear("hard")` but the returns an array of items in resolved or pending states. This can used to prematurely clear the queue and apply the remaining items to standard `Promise` methods like `.all()`, `.race()`or `.any()` etc.
- **`.on("event")`:** Adds or removes event listeners. AQ instances can take three event types
    - `"next"` event is fired per yielding of a pending or an already resolved item at the head of the queue. Some pending items at the head might of course get rejected and this won't prevent the `"next"` event from firing.
    - `"error"` event is fired once an item in the queue gets rejected except for the rejections those can be caught by the error handler (rejections at head). The error object is passed to the event handler.
    - `"empty"` event is fired when the queue becomes empty.

    When invoked, the `.on("event")` returns an object with two methods. **`.add(f)`** and **`.remove(n)`** whereas `f` is a function and `n` is an integer index value.

    - **`on("event").add(f)`:** Such as `var n = aq.on("error").add(e => doSomethingWith(e));`. The return value will be an integer which you may consider like the ID of the added event listener to be used to remove it at a later time.
    - **`on("event").remove(n)`:** Such as `aq.on("empty").remove(0);`

- **`.abort(item)`:** Not implemented yet. Remains as a soon to be feature.

**Properties**

As of v0.1, AQ instances have only one read only property which is `.size` that gives you the number of items in the queue.
